-- madmin --

madmin or mongo admin is aiming to be a simple web based tool for managing a mongo database.
The requirements are minimal enough to run it locally or on a webserver. 

Currently this application is in a very limited state and is not recommended for any sort of 
real usage.  There is no warnings when removing a database etc.

Flask
pymongo
jinja2
werkzeug
